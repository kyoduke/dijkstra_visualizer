# Introduction to Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This application is a visual implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm designed to simulate pathfinding in a coal mine environment. It provides an interactive platform to understand how Dijkstra's algorithm works to find the shortest path between two points in a grid, with obstacles representing mine barriers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this visualization tool is educational. It helps users:

1. Understand the mechanics of Dijkstra's algorithm
2. Visualize how the algorithm explores a space
3. See how pathfinding works around barriers
4. Learn about algorithmic efficiency in graph traversal

## Background

Dijkstra's algorithm, published by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem. The algorithm works by:

1. Assigning initial distance values to all nodes
2. Setting the distance for the initial node to zero and all other nodes to infinity
3. Visiting the unvisited node with the smallest known distance
4. Examining each unvisited neighbor of the current node
5. Calculating their tentative distances through the current node
6. Comparing the newly calculated distance to the current assigned value
7. Assigning the smaller distance and updating the path

In the context of our coal mine visualization, each cell in the grid represents a location in the mine, and barriers represent impassable areas.

## Technologies Used

The visualizer is built with:

- **Python**: The core programming language
- **Pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, providing functionality for graphics and user input

## Visual Representation

In our visualization:
- The algorithm's exploration is shown in real-time
- The final path is highlighted once found
- Different colors represent different states of nodes during exploration

This approach provides an intuitive understanding of how Dijkstra's algorithm works, making abstract concepts concrete and accessible.
